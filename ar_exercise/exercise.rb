# Hint, the following methods will help: `where`, `all`, `find`, `find_by`

# Use Active record to do the following, and store the results **in a variable**
# example: get every tenant in the DB
all_tenants = Tenant.all
apartments = Apartment.all

# get the first tenant in the DB
first_tenant = Tenant.find(1)
# get all tenants older than 65
elderly = all_tenants.where("age > ?",65)
# get all apartments whose price is greater than $2300
expensive = apartments.where("monthly_rent > ?",2300)
# get the apartment with the address "6005 Damien Corners"
specific = Apartment.find_by address: "6005 Damien Corners"
# get all tenants in that apartment
Tenant.where(apartment_id: 6)
# Use `each` and `puts` \n'
# Display the name and ID # of every tenant
display_all = all_tenants.each do |tenant| puts "Name: #{tenant.name}\nID: #{tenant.id}" end
# Iterate over each apartment, for each apartment, display it's address and rent price
all_apartments = apartments.each do |apt| puts "Address: #{apt.address}\n "
# Iterate over each apartment, for each apartment, display it's address and all of it's tenants
