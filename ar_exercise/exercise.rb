# FINDING / SELECTING

# Hint, the following methods will help: `where`, `all`, `find`, `find_by`

# Use Active record to do the following, and store the results **in a variable**
# example: get every tenant in the DB
all_tenants = Tenant.all
binding.pry
# get the first tenant in the DB
first_tenant = Tenant.first
# get all tenants older than 65
above_65 = Tenant.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM tenants WHERE age > 65")
# get all apartments whose price is greater than $2300
expensive_apartments = Apartment.where("monthly_rent > '2300'")
# get the apartment with the address "6005 Damien Corners"
apt_DC = Apartment.find_by_address("6005 Damien Corners")
# get all tenants in that apartment
apt_DC_res = Tenant.where("apartment_id = 6")
# Use `each` and `puts` to:
# Display the name and ID # of every tenant
name_age_all = Tenant.all.each do |x|
	puts "#{x.name} #{x.id}"
end
# Iterate over each apartment, for each apartment, display it's address and rent price
address_rent_all = Apartment.all.each do |x|
	puts "#{x.address} #{x.monthly_rent}"
