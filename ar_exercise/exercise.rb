# FINDING / SELECTING
################################################

# Hint, the following methods will help: `where`, `all`, `find`, `find_by`

# Use Active record to do the following, and store the results **in a variable**
# example: get every tenant in the DB
# all_tenants = Tenant.all
#
# # get the first tenant in the DB
# first_tenant = Tenant.first
#
# # get all tenants older than 65
# old_tenants = Tenant.select {|tenant| tenant[:age] > 65}
#
# # get all apartments whose price is greater than $2300
# high_rent = Apartment.select {|apartment| apartment[:monthly_rent] > 2300}
#
#
# # get the apartment with the address "6005 Damien Corners"
# find_apartment = Apartment.select {|apartment| apartment[:address] == "6005 Damien Corners"}
#
# # get all tenants in that apartment
# find_apt = Apartment.select {|apartment| apartment[:address] == "6005 Damien Corners"}
# find_tenants = Tenant.select {|tenant| tenant[:apartment_id] == find_apartment[0][:id]}

# Use `each` and `puts` to:
# Display the name and ID # of every tenant
# all_tenants.each do |tenant|
#   puts tenant[:name]
#   puts tenant[:id]
# end
# # Iterate over each apartment, for each apartment, display it's address and rent price
# all_apartments = Apartment.all
# # all_apartments.each do |apartment|
# #   puts  apartment[:address]
# #   puts apartment[:monthly_rent]
# # end
# # Iterate over each apartment, for each apartment, display it's address and all of it's tenants
# all_apartments.each do |apartment|
#   puts apartment[:address]
#   find_people = Tenant.select {|tenant|
#     tenant[:apartment_id] == apartment[:id]
